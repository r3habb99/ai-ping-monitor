# This is a placeholder for the icon.png file
# In a real implementation, you would place actual icon files here:
# - icon.png (256x256 for Linux)
# - icon.ico (for Windows)
# - icon.icns (for macOS)

# For now, you can use any network/wifi related icon
# Recommended: Download from https://iconify.design/ or create custom icons
